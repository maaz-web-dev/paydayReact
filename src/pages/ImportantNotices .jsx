          <h3>Tribal Lending Considerations</h3>
          <p className="section-text">
            Some partners may be Tribal Lending Enterprises (TLEs), operating under tribal and certain federal laws, which might present different rates, fees, and dispute resolution terms than state-licensed lenders. Review and understand all loan terms carefully, regardless of the lender's licensing.

          <h3>State Availability & Lender Terms</h3>
          <p className="section-text">
            Not all services are available in every state. Lenders, whether online or tribal, will provide all loan terms, fees, and rate information upon offering you a loan. We advise carefully reviewing these terms to ensure they align with your ability to repay.
